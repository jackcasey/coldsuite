# Cold Suite
## Curated cold storage and offline cryptocurrency tools

Note that Cold Suite is a 'package generator' of sorts and doesn't contain any tools of its own. It just references and downloads freely available web based tools when the script is run by a user.

I built this for myself as I was having difficulty finding all the best, most trustworthy tools on line and didn't relish keeping a package of them up to date. I decided to release it in the hope that others help me maintain and curate it, or tell me that I'm reinventing the wheel and point me at a better alternative!

I am looking for advice on the right tools to include. Preferably no real double ups in functionality and only the most trusted in the community.

Usage: ./coldsuite.rb

Requires:  ruby, curl, unzip.

Tested on: MacOS but I'm trying to make it portable.
