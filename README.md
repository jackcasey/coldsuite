# Cold Suite
## Curated cold storage and offline cryptocurrency tools

Note that Cold Suite is actually a 'package generator' of sorts and doesn't contain any tools of its own. 
It just references and downloads freely available web based tools when the script is run by a user.

I built this for myself and decided it might have wider value as I was having difficulty finding all the best, 
most trustworthy tools on line and didn't relish keeping a package of them up to date.

I am looking for advice on the right tools to include. Preferably no real double ups in functionality and only 
the most trusted in the community.

Usage: ./coldsuite.rb

Requires:  ruby, wget, unzip.

Tested on: MacOS
